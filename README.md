# Portfolio-Optimization-with-Graph-Theory

Portfolio Optimization using Graph Analytics is a data-driven approach that enables us to construct a portfolio of assets based on their inter-relationships. By using the concept of graph theory, we can model financial assets as nodes and their relationships as edges, and then identify the most optimal portfolio using various metrics like Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Return.
